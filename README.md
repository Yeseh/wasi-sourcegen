    C# Source generator for developing WASI modules and components

## About
> **Note**: this project is experimental and should not be used in any serious context

[dotnet-wasi-sdk]: https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/dotnet-wasi-sdk
[Component Model]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md

This repository contains a C# source generator and accompanying tests for generating WASI modules from pure C# code. It does this by generating C code which can be compiled to a WASI module using the [dotnet-wasi-sdk].

In the future, this will hopefully support the [Component Model].

## Usage
// TODO
See: SourceGenExample

The project can be built and run by executing:
> make run
